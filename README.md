## Why this exists

Claude Code, Cursor IDE, Codex CLI, and Gemini AI Studio store conversation history in various formats (JSONL files, SQLite databases) scattered across their data folders. These are hard to read and search through. This app gives you a unified interface to browse conversations from all these AI coding assistants, see usage stats, resume sessions, and find old discussions.

## Screenshots & Demo

## Current limitations

- **Beta software** - expect some rough edges and occasional bugs
- Large conversation histories (10,000+ messages) may take a moment to load initially
- Session creation only supports Claude Code (Cursor support planned)
- Cannot delete conversations or projects from the app (read-only for existing sessions)

## Data privacy

Everything runs locally. No data is sent to any servers. The app reads files from your `~/.claude` directory and Cursor's data folder. When creating new sessions, data is written only to your local Claude Code projects folder.

## Claude directory structure

The app expects this structure:

```
~/.claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/          # Project conversations
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [project-name]/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.jsonl    # Conversation files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ide/              # IDE data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ statsig/          # Analytics
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ todos/            # Todo lists
```

## Troubleshooting

**"No data found"**:
- Make sure you've used at least one AI coding assistant to create conversation history
- Check that the respective directories exist:
  - Claude Code: `~/.claude/projects/`
  - Codex CLI: `~/.codex/sessions/`
  - Gemini AI Studio: `~/.gemini/conversations/`
  - Cursor IDE: AppData/Cursor folder
- **macOS/Linux**: `ls ~/.claude ~/.codex ~/.gemini`
- **Windows**: Check `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.claude`, `.codex`, `.gemini`

**Performance issues**:
- Large sessions (1,000+ messages) use virtual scrolling for smooth performance
- If loading feels slow, try selecting a smaller session first
- Close other apps to free up memory if needed

**Search not working**:
- Make sure you've typed a query and pressed Enter
- Try quoted phrases for exact matches: `"specific error"`
- Check that the sessions you're searching contain the text

**Platform-specific issues**:
- **Windows**: If the app won't start, ensure WebView2 is installed (usually auto-installs)
- **Linux**: Install WebKitGTK if you see webkit-related errors: `sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`
- **macOS**: If you get a security warning, right-click the app and choose "Open"

**Update problems**: If auto-update fails, download the latest version manually from [Releases](https://github.com/ndokutovich/claude-code-history-viewer/releases).
